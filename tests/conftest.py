# tests/conftest.py
# This file can be used for pytest fixtures that are shared across multiple test files.
# For example, you might define a fixture for a test database connection here.


# Example fixture (can be removed or modified)
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
# def db_conn():
#     """Example fixture for a database connection."""
#     # Setup code for the db connection
#     print("\nSetting up DB connection (session scope)")
#     conn = ...
#     yield conn
#     # Teardown code for the db connection
#     print("\nTearing down DB connection (session scope)")
#     conn.close()
