# --- Test Cases for /courses/{course_id}/refresh-files Endpoint ---

# 1. Test successful dispatch of tasks for new/modified files:
#    - Mock `MoodleClient.get_courses_by_user` and `MoodleClient.get_all_courses` (if needed for course name resolution).
#    - Mock `MoodleClient.get_folder_files` to return a list of MoodleFile-like objects/dicts.
#    - Mock `PgvectorWrapper.ensure_table` to return True.
#    - Mock `PgvectorWrapper.is_file_new_or_modified`:
#        - Return True for some files (e.g., doc1.pdf, doc2.docx).
#        - Return False for others (e.g., doc3.pptx - to simulate an old, already processed file).
#    - Patch `src.entrenai.api.routers.course_setup.process_moodle_file_task.delay` (the .delay method of the task).
#    - Call the `/courses/{course_id}/refresh-files` endpoint.
#    - Assert the API response status code is 200.
#    - Assert the response JSON contains:
#        - "message" indicating tasks dispatched.
#        - "files_identified_for_processing" matches the count of files for which `is_file_new_or_modified` was True.
#        - "tasks_dispatched" matches the same count.
#        - "task_ids" is a list with the correct number of task IDs (mock `delay` to return a mock task object with an `id`).
#    - Assert `process_moodle_file_task.delay` was called the correct number of times.
#    - Assert `process_moodle_file_task.delay` was called with expected arguments for each relevant file
#      (this requires careful construction of expected arguments based on mock data and configurations).

# 2. Test with no files in Moodle folder:
#    - Mock `MoodleClient.get_folder_files` to return an empty list.
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert response status 200.
#    - Assert response message indicates no files found or processed.
#    - Assert "tasks_dispatched" is 0.
#    - Assert `process_moodle_file_task.delay` was not called.

# 3. Test with no new or modified files:
#    - Mock `MoodleClient.get_folder_files` to return files.
#    - Mock `PgvectorWrapper.is_file_new_or_modified` to always return False.
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert response status 200.
#    - Assert "files_identified_for_processing" is 0.
#    - Assert "tasks_dispatched" is 0.
#    - Assert `process_moodle_file_task.delay` was not called.

# 4. Test Moodle API failure when fetching files:
#    - Mock `MoodleClient.get_folder_files` to raise a `MoodleAPIError`.
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert response status code 502 (or as appropriate for MoodleAPIError handling).

# 5. Test PgVector DB failure when ensuring table:
#    - Mock `PgvectorWrapper.ensure_table` to return False or raise an exception.
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert appropriate error status code (e.g., 500).

# 6. Test failure during course name resolution (if that logic is complex and can fail):
#    - Mock Moodle client methods used for name resolution to fail.
#    - Assert appropriate error status code.

# --- Test Cases for /task/{task_id}/status Endpoint ---

# 1. Test task status: PENDING
#    - Patch `src.entrenai.api.routers.course_setup.AsyncResult` (the class itself).
#    - Configure the mock `AsyncResult` instance returned by `AsyncResult(task_id, app=celery_app)`:
#        - `task_result.status` = "PENDING"
#        - `task_result.result` = None
#        - `task_result.successful()` = False
#        - `task_result.failed()` = False
#    - Call the `/task/{task_id}/status` endpoint with a dummy task_id.
#    - Assert response status code 200.
#    - Assert response JSON matches expected structure for PENDING state (e.g., "status": "PENDING", "result": None).

# 2. Test task status: SUCCESS
#    - Patch `AsyncResult` as above.
#    - Configure the mock `AsyncResult` instance:
#        - `task_result.status` = "SUCCESS"
#        - `task_result.result` = {"filename": "doc1.pdf", "status": "success", "chunks_upserted": 10} (example task output)
#        - `task_result.successful()` = True
#        - `task_result.failed()` = False
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert response status 200.
#    - Assert response JSON matches expected structure for SUCCESS state, including the result.

# 3. Test task status: FAILURE
#    - Patch `AsyncResult`.
#    - Configure the mock `AsyncResult` instance:
#        - `task_result.status` = "FAILURE"
#        - `task_result.result` = "Simulated processing error" (or an Exception instance, the endpoint should convert to str)
#        - `task_result.traceback` = "Traceback string..."
#        - `task_result.successful()` = False
#        - `task_result.failed()` = True
#    - Call the endpoint.
#    - Assert response status 200.
#    - Assert response JSON matches expected structure for FAILURE state, including error message and traceback.

# 4. Test task status: RETRY (or other intermediate states if applicable)
#    - Similar to PENDING, configure `AsyncResult` mock for "RETRY" status.
#    - Verify response.

# 5. Test invalid task ID (Celery might return PENDING for unknown tasks, or raise an error depending on backend):
#    - This depends on how Celery's `AsyncResult` behaves with truly unknown IDs for the configured backend.
#    - Often, it defaults to a PENDING state.
#    - Call with a completely random task_id not known to any mock.
#    - Assert the behavior aligns with Celery's default for unknown tasks (likely PENDING).

# --- (Optional) End-to-End Test Idea (Comment for future consideration) ---
# - This would require a more complex setup with live/test-doubled Redis & Celery worker.
# - Scenario:
#   1. Setup: Ensure a Celery worker is running and connected to a test Redis.
#   2. Action: Call `/courses/{course_id}/refresh-files` endpoint.
#      - MoodleClient and PgvectorWrapper would need to be carefully mocked or set up for the test environment.
#      - The `process_moodle_file_task` itself could be partially mocked to avoid full AI/DB ops but still interact with Celery.
#   3. Poll: Take one of the `task_ids` from the response.
#   4. Loop: Call `/task/{task_id}/status` periodically until status is SUCCESS or FAILURE.
#   5. Verification:
#      - If SUCCESS: Check for expected side-effects (e.g., if `pgvector_db.mark_file_as_processed` was called,
#        verify this mock call if the DB itself isn't live for the test).
#      - If FAILURE: Check the error details in the response.
# - This is more of a system integration test and might be out of scope for typical unit/integration tests
#   focused on API and task dispatch logic, but good to keep in mind for comprehensive testing.
